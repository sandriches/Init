# Init
Init project (network/sysadmin intro) - Codam

Init is an introduction to system administration and networks. The project serves as a prerequisite to the next project ROGER SKYLINE, where students set up a linux based web server with specific constraints to allow the students to explore the tasks associated with web server management (protecting against attacks, changing IP address types and considering CI/CD).
